      <description>Over the course of the past two weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been revamping my conscript (writing system): Isyax√© Kiryada. While teaching the script to my friends, I realized that a fatal flaw with the script was that even after previous updates, it was unable to express certain consonant clusters, such as in the phrase cosyran ka (note that c is pronounced like ch, and sy is pronounced like sh). But why? Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I just design the script to support such a basic feature of the language to begin with?</description>

      <description>Welcome to kasreti&amp;rsquo;s crib! This is basically where I&amp;rsquo;ll put any long ramblings I have &amp;ndash; but what should you expect here?
Linguistics and conlangs I do reading on my own about linguistics quite often, so I&amp;rsquo;ll put any new discoveries that I find cool here and share them. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to put more explainer notes around to clarify some terminology since 90% of the people reading this blog will have zero clue about linguistics.</description>
